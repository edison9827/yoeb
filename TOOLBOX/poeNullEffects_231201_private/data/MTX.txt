//exclude some interesting models and spells, just in case they're important:
!/orion
!spell
!portal

//fixes:
!cospri
!InnsburyEdgeHeld
!Sunrise_Shield

//3.18: now uniq bodyarmours have the same paths as mtx:
!items/armours/bodyarmours

//======================================== REMOVE:

//remove generic MTX:
microtransaction
/mtx/

//remove misc MTX models:
/wings/
/capes/
attachment

//we can't remove "held.aoc" MTX because GGG named some random equipped items as "xxx_held.aoc" too.

//no need to specify pets, there're already some built-in rules.
