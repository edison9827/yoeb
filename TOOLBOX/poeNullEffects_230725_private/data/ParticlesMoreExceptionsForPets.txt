//2020 Notes:
//.aoc files contain .pets. We can't keep keep .aoc and disable .pets for the same skill.
// but we can disable .aoc and keep .pet. It helps to avoid MTX crashes.
// "microtransactions" or "microtransactions/Weapon_effects" line should be here. If we disable some MTX .pets, the game would crash.

//stable:
microtransactions/Weapon_effects

//2021 Notes:
//Seems like everything is ok now. We can disable anything we want.
