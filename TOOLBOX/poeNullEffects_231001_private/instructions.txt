Instructions:
0. Unzip .7z, start .exe.
1. The app might request path to your compression library. If you have no required .dll, input its name in Google Search and decide how to get it by yourself. I can't distribute that file.
2. Input your registered e-mail in the "Setup" window, press "Ok".
3. Input path to your PoE.exe, press  "Open", wait 5-10 seconds.
5. Switch the slider to any position you need (I prefer preset #2: "Boost for humans. Potato mode").
6. Press "Apply" button, wait 30-60 seconds until it's "Done".

Notes:
# GGG can change files during patches. In this scenario run the app and press "Apply" again.
# You can check "Menu -> Read Guide" if you really want to make some special modifications.
